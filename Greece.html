	<h2> 5 tourist sites that I want to visit</h2>
	<h3>1. Athens</h3>

	<a href="Atenas.jpg" alt = "photo de Atenas"><img src="Atenas.jpg"  WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="190"></a>
	<p>Athens is a city with more than 3,000 years of history and without a doubt, one of the most essential places to see in Greece . And although it is said of the capital of Greece that as soon as you step on it or love or hate it, we believe that if you spend 2 or 3 days getting to know it well and tour its most charming places, you will end up loving it and of course, wanting to return.
	In addition to the Parthenon and other temples of the Acropolis, you cannot miss a visit to the neighborhoods of Plaka, Monastiraki and Anafiótika, find the temple of Zeus, go up to Mount Lycabettus or to the Philopapo to see the sunset, enjoy the Central Market, enter in the Acropolis museum, stroll through the ancient Agora and the Roman Agora as well as enjoying traditional dishes such as moussaka, gyros or Greek yogurt.</p>

	<h3>2. Santorini</h3>
	<a href="Santorini.jpg" alt ="photo de Santorini"><img src="Santorini.jpg" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="190"></a>
	<p>The island of Santorini, located in the Cyclades archipelago, is for us the most beautiful island and one of the places to visit in Greece .
	This island, the product of a large volcanic eruption, is shaped like a crescent with several islands around its famous caldera, which also highlights its geological configuration, which gives it a different appearance from other Mediterranean islands, highlighting in this its beautiful towns, looming to cliffs, white facades, and vibrant blue doors and windows.
	Take a dip in one of its beaches, watch the sunset over the caldera from some viewpoints, take a hiking route, enjoy the atmosphere of Fira, fall in love while walking around Oía or visit archaeological sites such as Akrotiri, are some of the best things to see in Santorini .
	After our experience, especially if you travel in high season, we recommend you book the hotel well in advance, as prices are high and places are sold out very easily.</p>

	<h3>3. Meteora</h3>
	<a href="Meteora.jpg" alt ="photo de Meteora "><img src="Meteora.jpg" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="190"></a>
	<p>Meteora is a valley located in the north of Greece in which stone colossi of more than 600 meters high rise, in which several monasteries were built more than 7 centuries ago. These monasteries suspended from the sky, declared a World Heritage Site, are one of the most beautiful places to see in Greece and the world.
	Its location high in the mountains, gave it protection and a perfect place to meditate on the monks, and although they became 24 monasteries, many of them were destroyed during the Second World War, so there are currently 13 monasteries although only 6 can be visited, among which are the Great Meteor monastery and the Varlaam monastery, where inside you can see old frescoes as well as fantastic views of the valley.
	To stay in Meteora, the best option is the towns of Kastraki and Kalambaka, located very close to the monasteries. These two towns, located more than 4 hours by car from Athens, have a good hotel and restaurant infrastructure, although we recommend booking well in advance, especially if you travel in high season, as hotel places tend to be sold out easily, even faster than island hotels.</p>
